# This .gitignore file is intended to be used when version controlling VuGen
# scripts. It excludes files that are not needed for script replay or 
# regeneration.
# Note: This has not been tested with all vuser types.

# A copy of this .gitignore file is maintained at

# C-based VuGen scripts have the following structure:
#
# +-example_script/
#   +-Action.c
#   +-Breakpoints.xml (part of the script template since VuGen 11.50)
#   +-combined_example_script.c (created during compilation)
#   +-CompilerLogMetadata.xml (part of the script template since VuGen 11.50)
#   +-custom_body_variables.txt
#   +-data/ (contains recording snapshots. Needed for script regeneration)
#     +-events/
#     +-events1/
#     +-events2/
#     +-events3/
#     +-http.db/
#   +-default.cfg
#   +-default.usp
#   +-example_script.c.pickle (created during compilation)
#   +-example_script.ci (created during compilation)
#   +-example_script.sdf (part of the script template since VuGen 11.50)
#   +-example_script.usr
#   +-globals.h
#   +-logfile.log (created during compilation)
#   +-lrw_custom_body.h
#   +-mdrv.log (created during replay)
#   +-mdrv_cmd.txt (created during compilation)
#   +-options.txt (created during compilation)
#   +-output.txt (created during replay)
#   +-pre_cci.c (created during compilation)
#   +-ReplaySummaryReport.xml
#   +-result1/ (replay snapshots. These should not be version controlled)
#     +-Act0/
#     +-Act1/
#     +-Act2/
#     +-Icons/
#     +-Iteration0/
#     +-Iteration1/
#     +-Report/
#     +-Results.xml
#   +-result2/ (there may be multiple replay folders)
#   +-ThumbnailsCache.tmp (part of the script template since VuGen 11.50)
#   +-UserTasks.xml (part of the script template since VuGen 11.50)
#   +-vuser_end.c
#   +-vuser_init.c
#
# Notes and Caveats:
# * Any file type can be attached to a VuGen script.
# * Data files used by File parameters can be given a name with any extension.
# * Files may be referenced or #included from outside of the script folder.

# Unnecessary files added as part of the standard VuGen script template

# Files created during compilation

# Files needed for recording snapshots and script regeneration (optional)
# Note: may have a problem if there are any other version controlled folders 
# called "data"
#data/

# Files created during script replay (definitely don't need these)
